# flutter-docker-compiler
A script that compiles your Flutter project for Linux using Docker.

## Objective:
Compile a Flutter project for Linux with better compatibility across different Linux distributions, avoiding errors such as "GLIBC_2.34 not found".

## How?
The project is compiled through Docker, using the oldest Debian image compatible with Flutter.

## Requirements:
1. Linux environment (to run the script)
2. Docker installed

## How to use:
Clone this repository into the root of your Flutter project.
Open the terminal at the root of your project and execute the following commands:
1. `cd flutter-docker-compiler`
2. `sudo su` (enter your password)
3. `chmod +x build-linux.sh`
4. `./build-linux.sh`

The project will be built in the `flutter-docker-compiler/build folder`, and the symbols will be saved in the `flutter-docker-compiler/debug` folder.
The flutter-linux image will be made available so that it doesnâ€™t need to be recreated every time, reducing the build time in future executions.
If you make any modifications to your project, simply run `./build-linux.sh` again.

## Tip:
Add `/flutter-docker-compiler` to your .gitignore file.
